Instead of sending your whole password hash to a server to ask 'is this pwned?', your browser sends just the first 5 characters of the hash and asks for a list of all pwned passwords that start with those same characters.

A long, simple-to-remember passphrase (e.g., 'tree car blue sky') is often stronger and more secure than a short, complex one (e.g., 'Tr3e!') because the sheer number of possible combinations is vastly larger."
