This tool exists to pull back the curtain, decoding all these different formats and presenting them in one clear view, so you know exactly what story your photos are telling before you share them."

It works by identifying and discarding the data blocks containing metadata, then stitching the file back together with only the essential image data.

                    "answer": "This usually means the metadata was never there or was scrubbed. Many social media sites automatically remove metadata when you upload photos. Also, simple images created with basic graphics editors often don't contain any camera-related metadata to begin with."

                    "answer": "Not at all. Some RAW formats are like a camera's digital negative and can't be displayed directly by web browsers. The tool can still read the metadata perfectly, which is the main event. For a visual, you'd need specialized software, but for data-checking, you're in the right place."

You can keep it for your records, use it in a script, or analyze it further in other applications. It's your data, so you should be able to take it with you."
