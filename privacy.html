                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>At ToolThump, your privacy is our top priority. We want to be transparent about how our tools work and what data, if any, is collected.</p>
                <h2>Client-Side Processing</h2>
                <p>All tools on ToolThump operate entirely within your web browser. This means that any data you input or process using our tools (e.g., text, images, passwords) is processed directly on your device. It is never transmitted to our servers, nor is it stored by us.</p>
                <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
                <p>We do not collect any personal identifiable information (PII) from our users. We do not use cookies for tracking purposes, and we do not require registration or login to use any of our tools.</p>
                <h2>Analytics (Optional)</h2>
                <p>We may use privacy-friendly analytics (e.g., Google Analytics with IP anonymization) to understand general website traffic patterns, such as which tools are most popular. This data is aggregated and completely anonymous, and cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>
                <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>Our website may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>
                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
                <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
