                    <p class="subtitle">Your privacy is fundamental. Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown of how ToolThump handles
                        data (or rather, how it doesn't).</p>

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-halved icon"></i>Client-Side Processing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Every tool available on ToolThump operates <span class="highlight">entirely within your web browser</span> on your local machine. When you upload an image, process a video, or transform text, the computation happens on your computer's processor. Your files and data are <span class="highlight">never sent to, processed by, or stored on any external server</span>. This architecture is fundamental to our commitment to privacy; what happens on your computer stays on your computer.

                        <p>
                            We do not collect, log, or store any <span class="highlight">personally identifiable information (PII)</span>. This includes your name, email address, physical address, and IP address. There are no user accounts to create and no databases to store user information. We have no interest in tracking you. Your activity on this website is your own and is not monitored by us.

                        <p>
                            To improve ToolThump, we need to understand which tools are being used and how visitors find the site. We use a privacy-focused analytics service that <span class="highlight">does not use cookies and anonymizes all visitor data</span>. All we see are aggregated statistics, such as "200 people used the Image Converter today." This helps us make better decisions about which features to build and improve without ever knowing who you are.
